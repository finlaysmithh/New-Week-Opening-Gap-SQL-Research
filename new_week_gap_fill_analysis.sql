-- Permanent New Week Opening Gap Fill Analysis for 20+ Pip Gaps (4-Week Check)
-- ====================================================
-- This script:
-- 1. Computes the new week opening gap (current week open minus previous week close)
--    and converts it into pips (1 pip = 0.0001 for EUR/USD).
-- 2. Filters for gap candidates with an absolute gap (in pips) of at least 20.
-- 3. Determines if the gap is filled in:
--      - Week 1: current week (using daily data from that week)
--      - Week 2: the week immediately after the current week
--      - Week 3: two weeks after the current week
--      - Week 4: three weeks after the current week
--    For a positive gap, a fill is when any day's low is <= previous week's close.
--    For a negative gap, a fill is when any day's high is >= previous week's close.
-- 4. Computes an overall fill flag: 1 if the gap is filled in any of weeks 1â€“4, otherwise 0.
-- 5. Aggregates overall statistics.
